 hellenic_events.109.t: "Hermaea"
 hellenic_events.109.d: "'All those who make a living trading their wares, offer you incense, and beg you to swell their profits.' thus wrote Ovid. Hermaea, a festival dedicated to Hermes begins. Merchants from all over the city and from near areas have all gathered before the temple of Hermes in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. After offering a sacrifice to the protector of commerce, they draw water from the fountain near the temple and then sprinkle their goods and hair with a laurel bough and pray for good luck."

 hellenic_events.109.b: "Hmm, it is interesting that a god of commerce is also the protector of thieves."
 hellenic_events.110.t: "Inspirations of Hermes"
 hellenic_events.110.d: "You went to a local market recently, a place under protection of Hermes. You found traders trying to cheat their customers. 'Catch the thief!' cried a woman, you squinted in the direction of the voice and saw a boy running with a gold necklace in his hand. 'Smart boy, how could he steal a necklace when its owner is wearing it?' you said to yourself."

 hellenic_events.111.t: "Adonia"
 hellenic_events.111.d: "'Aphrodite, you changer of hearts. We shall perform your rites. May your blessing be on us.' the priestesses complete the prayer and the ritual of Adonia begins. Female attendants of the goddess, chosen from all women in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], undress the statue and wash it ceremonially with warm water. Once the statue is dry, fresh flowers are offered and it is garlanded with myrtle. And then the statue is carried out of her temple, the celebrating begin."
 hellenic_events.111.a: "Aphrodite blesses those who love her!"
 hellenic_events.111.b: "The grumpy are pacified, anger turned into joy. What is the secret of such power of Aphrodite?"
 hellenic_events.112.t: "Inspirations of Aphrodite"
 hellenic_events.112.d: "You talked with wise men and read ancient stories, you feel like you have found the reason. The Romans regarded Aphrodite as their divine mother and Ares as divine father, and the glory of the empire was thus built upon the combination of love and war."
 hellenic_events.112.a: "A wise ruler uses [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] love wisely."
 hellenic_events.113.t: "Crisis of Faith"
 hellenic_events.113.d: "You acted cynically toward your patron god but didn't get punished, you prayed and received no reply. You feel like you have lost faith in your god while the priests told it is just a crisis of faith that everyone will experience. Maybe I have been praying to the wrong one and it is time to change?"
 hellenic_events.113.a: "It is a test of gods which I shall pass."
 hellenic_events.113.b: "Zeus is the supreme god."

 lollard_events.1.d:0 "Following the destruction and removal of Papist symbols, Lollard churches were left somewhat bare of decoration. It has been decreed that in place of these blasphemous icons, the Royal Arms of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to be displayed. The presence of the Royal Arms cements in the public consciousness the reality of the new order; that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is appointed by God not only as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of $COUNTRY$, but also as Supreme Governor of the Church."
 lollard_events.1.a:0 "Display the Royal Arms proudly in every church."
 lollard_events.2.t:0 "Recusancy"
 lollard_events.2.d:0 "Attending Lollard services is mandatory in the [Root.GovernmentName] of $COUNTRY$. Recusancy is punishable by harsh fines. A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Catholics, and thus all Catholics may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court. The mere suggestion of recusancy can destroy one’s reputation at court."

 lollard_events.3.t:0 "Prophesying and Sermons"
 lollard_events.3.d:1 "The Lollard Church does not require that its clergy devote much time to preaching. A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."
 lollard_events.3.a:0 "Ban these nonconformist sermons."
 lollard_events.3.b:0 "Let them preach as they wish."
 lollard_events.4.t:0 "Parliamentary Debate on Doctrine"
 lollard_events.4.d:2 "The [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetParliamentName] is often called upon to debate matters of religion. Typically, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will propose a new wave of reforms for the Lollard Church and [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammer] will take a stance along established factional lines; the Members in the Commons more likely to support radical or even Puritan measures, the Lords temporal more likely to favour a more conservative approach. Rarely does the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way precisely, and when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does, coercive measures are often involved."

 lollard_events.5.d:1 "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Lollard Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate’ began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates’ who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."
 lollard_events.5.a:0 "Ignore this nonsense."

 lollard_events.5.c:0 "Find and arrest the authors."
 lollard_events.6.t:0 "Prayer Book Rebellions"
 lollard_events.6.d:0 "The doctrines of the Lollard Church are contained within the Book of Common Prayer. It is a book that needs periodic revisions to accord with changes in Lollard thought, as it shifts between more radical and more traditional theology. The most recent edition contains material that has greatly angered the people of [prayer_book_province.GetName], many of whom still cling to Catholic dogmas and practices. They have risen up in revolt, demanding that the Book be reverted to its previous edition."
 lollard_events.6.a:0 "Repeal the new edition and make traditionalist concessions."

 lollard_events.7.t:0 "Crypto-Catholic Statesman"
 lollard_events.7.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Reformation did not sway the hearts and minds of the entire population. Many continue to harbour Catholic sympathies, even among the court. It has been discovered that $STATESMAN$ has been secretly attending a Catholic Mass, a practice strictly forbidden by law. If exposed, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] stands to lose all of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] land and property, and will no longer be eligible for public office."

 lollard_events.7.c:0 "Off with his head!"
 lollard_events.8.t:0 "Prayers to Saints"
 lollard_events.8.d:0 "When $COUNTRY$ broke with Rome, we did away with the superstitious notion that prayers should be directed to the Saints rather than to God himself. As our new theology has no place for the papist concept of Purgatory, there is no need for Saints to intercede on behalf of our souls. Despite this, many people continue the practice of praying to Saints, and many churches give excessive reverence to their patron."
 lollard_events.8.a:0 "It's harmless, we can allow this."
 lollard_events.8.b:0 "Uniformity must be enforced"
 lollard_events.9.t:0 "Abolition of Feast Days"
 lollard_events.9.d:0 "The Catholic liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labor. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."
 lollard_events.9.a:0 "Abolish more feast days."
 lollard_events.9.b:0 "Let them have their fun."
 lollard_events.10.t:0 "Puritans Leaving for the Colonies"
 lollard_events.10.d:0 "The Puritans have for some time criticized the hierarchy and doctrines of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Reformation has to their eyes merely replaced the Pope with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they openly denounce the state’s slothful attitude to reform. Theological disputes aside, Puritans have also been persecuted as nonconformists, depending on the leanings of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Finally exhausted by the religious affairs of Europe, many Puritans have decided to migrate in the New World. They have organized themselves into a colonial company an requested a charter to establish new settlements in the Americas."
 lollard_events.10.b:1 "Integrate them into an established colony."
 lollard_events.10.a:1 "Let them build their own settlement."
 lollard_events.11.t:0 "Controversy over Vestments"
 lollard_events.11.d:0 "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Lollard Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Lollards wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Catholic priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."
 lollard_events.11.a:0 "Allow traditional vestments."
 lollard_events.11.b:0 "Surplices only."
 lollard_events.11.c:0 "Denounce all vestments."
 lollard_events.12.t:0 "Smashing Altars"
 lollard_events.12.d:0 "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Lollard Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."
 lollard_events.12.a:0 "Smash the altars and imprison papist protesters!"

 lollard_events.13.d:0 "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Catholics employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."

 lollard_events.14.t:0 "The Church of $COUNTRY$"
 lollard_events.14.d:0 "As the Protestant Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favoring the Protestant cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."

 lollard_events.15.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has landed in the unenviable position of being both a religious nonconformist and the Supreme Governor of the Church of $COUNTRY$.

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.202.b: "There is no need to change the situation."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.202.c: "Fiddle with the system to ensure the dictator's power is limited."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.203.t: "Family Feud"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.203.d: "Upon the election of our new ruler, violence broke out between several family members of our leader.

The recent legislation passed seems to be working incredibly well; it is the kind of policy that would have been stopped by a convoluted governmental setup. Our simple and effective system is working great."

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.t: "Election Tampering"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.d: "A recent slew of complaints over the recent shift in leadership have brought forth allegations of election tampering from our peasantry. It would seem as though election results were, by some unknown entity and to an unknown degree, tampered with to match the perpetrator's desired outcome. Though we cannot reverse the damage that has already been done, a few dedicated branches of the dissenting peasants are threatening revolt if we do not provide the culprit. Who shall we present as a scapegoat?"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.a: "The burghers have been acting shady lately."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.b: "A few nobles seem a bit too friendly with the fraudulent candidate."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.c: "Might as well pin it on a heretical branch of clergy."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.205.e: "It was the cultists I tell you!"

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.207.d: "A highly succesfull general has been amassing fame, fortune and a loyal army. He has increasingly been aligning himself with the popular factions in our capital, threatening to disturb the balance of powers.

 GE_reform_cycle_republic.208.t: "Balance of Power"
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.208.d: "The balance between the patrician parties, the wealty aristocrats and the populace seems to be pretty stable at the moment. We could take advantage of this to accept a bribe from one of the parties without upsetting the balance of power too much. "
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.208.a: "Lets enjoy the peace while it lasts."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.208.b: "Take a bribe from the Aristocrats."

They are currently a small movement, but if we do not clamp down on them quickly, they will grow substantially."

In total, our people are much happier and more productive than before. There must be a way to exploit this."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.402.a: "Raise taxes for a temporary boost in income."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.402.b: "Allow the people their elation."
 GE_reform_cycle_republic.402.c: "Find the perfect tax rate to equalize production and taxation."
